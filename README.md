## FYI 
- For this project we are used prisma and Express Js structure to combination build REST + MVC API sercvice
- First i set the configuration for eslint to be good structure in my program
- Dont forget to build structure to be good
- And then i testing my controller to unit testing and api to be integration testing for this
- I get the coverage to see the presentace for good or not , i launch my testing
- Deployment? yes i deploy my project in railway
- I use dbms from railway to public db and deploy my back end to be create easy used my rest Api.
  
## Getting Started

if you need to start api from your local and you want to change more algorithm from this, u can cloning first:

```
run the server with Node JS runtime and i am used Node JS v 18+

NB : Before you start the apps you should addded confguration to .env

```javascript

DATABASE_URL_TEST="DATABASE URL FOR TESTING"
DATABASE_URL="DATABASE URL FOR DEVELOPMENT "
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="ACCESS TOKEN TO NODE MAILER CONFIG"
NODEMAILER_EMAIL="EMAIL ACCOUNT TO NODEMAILER"
NODEMAILER_PASSWORD="PASSWORD ACCOUNT TO NODEMAILER"

```
After this you can started the apps

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
